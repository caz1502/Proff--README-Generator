## Professional-README-Generator

## The Task

```md
Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). 

The application will be invoked by using the following command:
bash
node index.js

Provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. Submit a link to the video _and_ add it to the README of your project.
```
